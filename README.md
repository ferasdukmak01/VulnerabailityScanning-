# VulnerabailityScanning-
You’ll conduct a scan on two servers: an internal host running Jenkins, an automation server for building, testing and deploying code; and an external web server that hosts your company’s main website. We’ve suffixed the hostnames of these machines with .int if they are internal, and .com if they are external.
